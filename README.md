# LeetCode was HARD until I Learned these 15 Patterns (C++)

A structured collection of LeetCode problem solutions organized by 15 key patterns in C++. This repository simplifies complex coding problems by breaking them down into patterns, providing an intuitive way to approach and solve them.

## Patterns Covered

1. **Prefix Sum**: Solve problems involving cumulative sums efficiently.
2. **Two Pointers**: Ideal for sorted arrays or linked lists, optimizing space and time.
3. **Sliding Window**: Useful for finding subarrays with specific properties in linear time.
4. **Fast and Slow Pointers**: Helps detect cycles in linked lists or locate the middle element.
5. **Linked List In-Place Reversal**: Reverse linked list sections without additional memory.
6. **Monotonic Stack**: Efficiently manage problems involving the next/previous greater or smaller element.
7. **Top K Elements**: Identify the top `K` largest or smallest elements in a dataset.
8. **Overlapping Intervals**: Solve interval-related problems by merging or checking overlaps.
9. **Modified Binary Search**: Adapt binary search for rotated arrays, closest elements, and other variations.
10. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Recursively explore all nodes in tree or graph structures.
11. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Optimal for shortest path and level-order traversal in trees/graphs.
12. **Matrix Traversal**: Navigate 2D matrices using specific patterns.
13. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Patterns**: Solve optimization problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems.
14. **Longest Common Substring/Subsequence**: Techniques for finding longest subsequences or substrings.
15. **Max Heap and Min Heap**: Use heaps for efficient access to min or max elements in a collection.
